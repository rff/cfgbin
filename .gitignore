# Full remove of config folders/programs from cfg/.
# disclaimer: I am trying to use ~/.config as a symlink to cfg. The good thing
# is that we can easily see and save config changes in all my favorite
# programs. But because all programs write to there (or is it writes to ~/ we
# are symlinking them to ~/.config/) we ended up with a lot of useless and
# unwanted files. So this list bellow may get a little long.
